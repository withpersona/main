**Welcome to Persona!
**

Persona provides a powerful, secure platform to help organizations collect, verify, store, and analyze the identity of any individual in the world. A frontend, conversion-optimized user interface makes it easy to start verifying identities in minutes.

With Persona, you configure a template to specify which verifications an individual needs to complete through the frontend flow. As individuals progress through the template, they submit the required information to be verified, such as a government ID, and create a verification . Each time an individual attempts to complete the set of verifications specified by a template, they create an inquiry, which contains the information collected from the submitted verifications, the results of those verifications, and passively-collected contextual data like IP address that can be used to identify suspicious activity. Once an individual completes an inquiry, you can use the verified information to run an additional report such as a global watchlist or sanctions check on the individual.

Here you’ll find comprehensive information for integrating with Persona and our API endpoints. We’ve tried to make this documentation user-friendly and example-filled.

If you’re planning to use our API in Production, please refer to the API Reference for detailed instructions on how to use the API, and our Privacy Policy to understand how to handle the data.

The most comprehensive way to integrate Persona is to setup an Embedded Flow for web or integrate with one of our Mobile SDKs, and the fastest way without any code is to setup a Hosted Flow.
